# when using external authentication, prefetch_room_sessions determines whether we should try to
# snag the cocomo "room session" at the time of cocomo room preallocation and save it in the CachedCocomoRoom
# as a serialized_room_session.  The good thing about enabling this is that you don't need to make any
# CocomoApi requests at launch time; the bad thing is that these prefetched (cached) sessions can go bad for 
# reasons we don't really control/understand.
