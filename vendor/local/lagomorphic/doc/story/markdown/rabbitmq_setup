# RabbitMQ Installation and Configuration

## For Macintosh

 * `sudo port install rabbitmq-server`
 * edit `/etc/hosts` and add your hostname to the end of the `127.0.0.1` line, for instance: `127.0.0.1       localhost rlineweaverlmac2` (we are not entirely sure this is necessary)
 * start the server with: `sudo rabbitmq-server`

## For Ubuntu/Debian

 * Add the following line to `/etc/apt/sources.list`:<br/>
   `deb http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian/ testing main`
 * Add the public key (optional):<br/>
   `curl http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc | apt-key add -`
 * `sudo apt-get update`<br/>
   `sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server`
 * It starts automatically, and you have `/etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server` as well.

## Set up `/etc/sudoers` for `rabbitmqctl`

For convenience, as well as for running the `lagomorphic` plugin tests, it is helpful to configure your `/etc/sudoers` to allow your local user to execute `rabbitmqctl` (actually `/bin/sh`) as the `rabbitmq` user without having to type your password.

**WARNING: you can lose root access to your system if you mess up the sudoers file.  Always keep another root session open when editing /etc/sudoers.  Also use visudo!**

On my Mac, I was able to accomplish that by adding the following line to `/etc/sudoers`:<br/>
  `%admin ALL=(rabbitmq) NOPASSWD: SETENV: /bin/sh`

On rshbgdev05, I used the following line:<br/>
  `deploy ALL=(rabbitmq) NOPASSWD: SETENV: /bin/sh`

 * The first field could be your username, or a group name preceded by a `%` character.
 * The second field (`ALL`) indicates the host
 * The target user name ("run as") is in parenthesis - don't change that one.
 * `NOPASSWD:` means that we don't need to prompt for the password
 * `SETENV:` means that you're allowed to copy your own environment variables (PATH, etc.) into the new shell
 * `/bin/sh` is the command that you're allowed to run as `rabbitmq`.  Could also be `ALL`

Note: on Mac OS version 10.5.x, not all of the above options are supported by the version of sudo that ships with the OS (1.6.8).  Try `sudo port install sudo` in this case.

## Run app-specific setup

 * `cp config/rabbit.defaults.yml config/rabbit.yml` and edit as appropriate (optional, the defaults are probably fine for local development)
 * `./rake rabbit:setup`
 * `RAILS_ENV=test ./rake rabbit:setup`
 * `./rake test:plugin:lagomorphic` to see if everything is working
