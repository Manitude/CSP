h1. About amq-protocol.

amq-protocol is an AMQP 0.9.1 serialization library for Ruby. It is not an
AMQP client: amq-protocol only handles serialization and deserialization.
If you want to write your own AMQP client, this gem can help you with that.

h2. How does amq-protocol relate to amqp gem, amq-client and libraries like bunny?

See "this page about AMQP gems family":https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-client/blob/master/README.textile


h2. Installation

If you use Bundler and want to use the very latest version, add this to your Gemfile:

<pre>
gem 'amq-protocol', :git => 'https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-protocol.git'
</pre>


h2. Development

h3. Inspection

If you need to see what AMQP methods are encoded, just regenerate the protocol file using @./tasks.rb generate --development@ and then set @$DEBUG@ to @true@ for which parts of code you want to see the debug statements.

h3. Contributing

If you want to change some code, don't edit @lib/amq/protocol/client.rb@ â€”
that file is generated from @protocol.rb.pytemplate@
which is a template file used by @codegen.py@. You can re-generate by running
<pre>nake ./tasks.rb generate</pre>
Please note that nake gem only runs on Ruby 1.9.2.
