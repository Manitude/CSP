There are some Rosetta Stone modifications in this copy of the JSON gem.  All of them are implemented as additional files on top of the original gem; none of the gem's distribution files have been modified (except for .specification file).

The local modifications were made to allow embedding platform-specific compiled binaries of the JSON C extension into the gem to enable easier distribution and version management.

Adding a build for a new architecture is simple:
 1. Install the JSON gem on your system as you normally would (gem install json)
 2. Copy the outputs of ruby -e 'p RUBY_PLATFORM' and ruby -e 'p RUBY_VERSION' on your system (minus the quotes)
 3. In lib/rosettastone/json/ext/ create the required directory structure (mkdir -p RUBY_PLATFORM/RUBY_VERSION)
 4. Compile and copy over your binaries to the newly created directory structure
 5. ./rake system_readiness
 6. Test & commit

Upgrading to a new version of the JSON gem should be simple:
 1. Install the JSON gem on your system as you normally would (gem install json)
 2. In environment.rb, specify the version explicitly in the config.gem line for the json gem
 3. ./rake gems:unpack
 4. Recreate the changes needed in .specification file. See WebDev SVN commit 56337 for reference
 5. Copy lib/rosettastone from the previous version of the embedded gem into the new one
 6. On each supported platform, rebuild and recopy the binaries into the appropriate platform-specific directories
 7. ./rake system_readiness
 8. Test & commit

Using this embedded gem in your Rails application:
 1. Edit svn:externals in vendor/gems to add the gem
 2. Edit config/environment.rb, and add a line as follows:
    config.gem 'json'
 3. Add config/initializers/json.rb, with the following contents:
---------
# The embedded gem is already loaded; these must be loaded after the rest of the environment

# There used to be a workaround hack here but is no longer.
# I'm done dealing with Rails' stupidity regarding to_json.
# Bottom line, you will NEVER be able to utilize JSON Gem's
# native extension to generate JSON Strings with Rails.

# run ./rake system_readiness to verify compatibility
require 'rosettastone/system_readiness/json'
---------
