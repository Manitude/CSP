# This config file is for the ssl_functionality plugin.
# This is an instance-specific configuration file that should be renamed to ssl.yml to take effect; 
# however, config/ssl.yml is optional and the lack of the config file is equivalent to "enable_ssl: false"
#
# Note that these settings are overridden for Selenium tests in selenium_config.rb
#
# If enable_ssl is true for a given instance, then the before filter (RosettaStone::ForceSsl) will trigger 
# a redirect to an HTTPS URL if it is accessed over HTTP.
enable_ssl: false

# http_port and https_port are optional.  They default to 80 and 443, respectively.  They are mostly useful 
# for local development where nonstandard ports are often used.
#http_port: 3000
#https_port: 8443
