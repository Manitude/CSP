SSL Functionality
=================

Helpers for apps that need to support SSL under various conditions.

See also: config/ssl.yml and the sample file included in this directory.

Instructions for integrating into your app:
-------------------------------------------

 * Add this plugin to your app
 * cp vendor/plugins/ssl_functionality/ssl.yml.sample config/
 * svn add config/ssl.yml.sample
 * cp config/ssl.yml.sample config/ssl.yml
 * svn ignore that file
 
Usage:
------

In the simplest case, you can just add the following line to a controller that should use SSL whenever the instance is configured for it:

before_filter RosettaStone::ForceSsl

In more complex cases you may be interested in the methods added to ActionController in lib/action_controller_ext.rb.
