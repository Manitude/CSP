How to use:

Put a config file called 'known_instances.yml' under RAILS_ROOT/config if you wish to override the known_instances.yml included with the plugin. The config is defined like so:

staging:
  - benjamin
  - marx
  - bloch
  - walker
  - texas
  - ranger

fallthrough: development


The key is the name of an instance, and the YAML array elements are hostnames of machines in that instance cluster.
The only effect 'fallthrough' has is to provide a guess of what the instance is in the output of the instance_name method.

Usage of the class is as follows:

RosettaStone::InstanceDetection.staging?                  # => true
RosettaStone::InstanceDetection.production?               # => false
RosettaStone::InstanceDetection.unknown?                  # => false
RosettaStone::InstanceDetection.instance_name             # => 'staging'
RosettaStone::InstanceDetection.hostname                  # => 'bloch'
RosettaStone::InstanceDetection.instance_is?('staging')   # => true

RosettaStone::InstanceDetection.instance_is?('bababooey') # => ArgumentError, "No instance called 'bababooey' has been defined."
RosettaStone::InstanceDetection.bababooey?                # => RuntimeError, "No instance called 'bababooey' has been defined."
