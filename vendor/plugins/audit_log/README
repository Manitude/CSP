Audit Logging Plugin
=======================

Sets up audit logging for an ActiveRecord class. Example:

  class License < ActiveRecord::Base
    audit_logged
  end

Available options are:

  :loggable_actions - one or all of [:create, :update, :destroy]. Enables audit logging for
  the selected ActiveRecord actions. Defaults to logging creates, updates, and destroys.

  :except - a symbol or array of symbols of attributes to not audit log changes on

  :only - a symbol or array of symbols of attributes to only audit log changes on, ignoring
  changes to any other attributes

  :also_log - a symbol or array of symbols of non ActiveRecord default attributes to log
  changes on. Example:
  
     class License < ActiveRecord::Base 
       audit_logged :also_log => :agreement_type
      
       def agreement_type=(type_string)
         self.downcased_agreement_type = type_string.downcase
       end
       
       def agreement_type
         downcased_agreement_type.upcase
       end
     end
  
  :ignore_special_attributes - true or false, sets whether to ignore special AR columns like
  created_on and lock_version. Defaults to true.

  :associate - true or false, sets whether to define the audit_log_records and related
  associations on the class audit logging is being enabled on. Defaults to true.

  :audit_logger_class - specifies a replacement class to use as the audit_logger object. This
  can be overridden to provide a class with more specialised behaviour such as recording an
  identifier for the entity making changes to a record. Defaults to using 
  RosettaStone::AuditLog::AuditLogger, it is recommended you extend this class when adding
  functionality.


The logs can be accessed via the .audit_log_records association on an instance of an audit_logged
class, and the update_audit_logs destroy_audit_logs create_audit_logs associations for specific
kinds of audit log.
